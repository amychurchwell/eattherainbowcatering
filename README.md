[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org)

I used [this Gatsby starter](https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms) as a jumping off point.

## Prerequisites

- Node (I recommend using v8.2.0 or higher)
- [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)
- [Netlify CLI](https://github.com/netlify/cli)

## Run

```
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

## Purgecss

This plugin uses [gatsby-plugin-purgecss](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-purgecss/) and [bulma](https://bulma.io/). The bulma builds are usually ~170K but reduced 90% by purgecss.
